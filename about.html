    <p>I am an enthusiastic and dedicated learner with a strong passion for coding and technology. Currently, I am building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C programming, and exploring the basics of competitive programming. Every new concept I learn motivates me to dive deeper and expand my skills even further.

I love solving problems, understanding how things work behind the scenes, and turning ideas into functional, creative projects. My interest in coding keeps growing every day, and I enjoy experimenting with different technologies, improving my logic, and continuously challenging myself.

I believe that consistent learning and practice are the keys to becoming a skilled developer. I am excited to keep learning, create impactful projects, and grow into a confident and capable software developer in the future.😁</p>
